</span>The proliferation of cookbooks, books on nutrition, magazines and other
publications devoted to these subjects and, therefore, the number of people
interested in them, is one of the most notable phenomena of our time. This need
or sense of curiosity is clearly a result of the progress which has been made
with respect to health matters in today's society, not only on an individual
level but for society as a whole. As far as Spanish cooking is concerned, which
has never been given much notoriety throughout its history, there is also a
sense of evening the score with French and Italian cooking, which has always
overshadowed that of its European counterpart.<o:p>

lack of interest in Spanish cooking is quite odd considering how good Spanish
cooking has always been. There has always been a wealth of tasty wild game,
fruits and vegetables in Spain for which the Italians and especially the French
owe a lot. Spain is where the seed and the original name came from for apricots,
artichokes, aubergines (eggplant), pumpkin, asparagus... these products being
the raw materials for many foods and dishes such as meatballs, marinades, stews,
casseroles, jams and a variety of sweets and pastries. And let's not forget the
great American contribution to the European diet, made possible by the Spanish,

fact, Spain had everything, but not for everyone. The poor, which made up the

Lazarillo de Tormes served: &quot;No hay tal cosa en el mundo, para vivir mucho,
como comer poco&quot; which could be loosely translated as &quot;Eat little to
live long&quot;. Travellers to Spain, especially the French, were shocked to
discover how poor the taverns and innswere, and like Furetière, came to the
conclusion, that &quot;the Spanish live on garlic&quot;. Upon returning, they
would tell of famished noblemen who strolled around with toothpicks between
their teeth, in order to give the appearance that they had just eaten. The issue

the Canary Islands the problem of nutrition was an even more difficult one to
resolve. This depended largely on the success of local agriculture, and droughts.
And bad wheat harvests often ravaged the population, especially on the poorer
islands. On several occasions Lanzarote and Fuerteventura were almost deserted
due to the exodus of their people, who emigrated to the larger islands,
especially Tenerife, just for the sake of survival. During the drought of 1785,
the people of the island of El Hierro lived on plants &quot;which had never been
considered fit for human consumption, and many not even for animals&quot;; on La
Gomera the people were forced to eat ferns. People on the larger islands lived
somewhat better because they were able to buy wheat from abroad. On the other
hand, as was the case of the Spanish mainland, a person's diet often just
depended on his economic situation. Although we do not have much information
about the sweets and delicacies that the rich ate, we do know they consumed
certain kinds of sweets made from honey and sugar, some of which are still made
today. They ate figs, dates and bananas, the latter being sent to friends and
relatives on the Spanish mainland in the form of preserves, tightly packed in
jars. They would turn almost black and probably sour before arriving, and I
assume no one would want to eat them today. However, in those days, these
preserves were a much appreciated gift in Madrid.<o:p>

any case, the islands as a whole, and particularly the larger islands, offered
an abundant and varied diet. It is worth mentioning again however that the
distribution of food left much to be desired. When they did eat, the poor
islanders ate little and poorly. Due to a lack of wood and the money to buy it,
most of the islanders never ate hot food until well into the 19th century. Some
ate too much and others poorly. The composition of their diet was aberrant (and
in some ways still is), consisting of about 90% cereals (principally bread and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">gofio</i>
- toasted grains) (as opposed to 65% on the Spanish mainland, 50% in France, 42%
in England), and about 7% milk and meat (29% on the Spanish mainland, 46% in
France, 53% in England), according to a study done in 1962. Meat also lost a
large part of its dietary importance, for the daily consumption of meat in Santa

for a Canarian cuisine to develop, something which could not be conceived of in
those times, but which now is a reality. There is no doubt that in earlier times
one could eat well on the islands, but eating well back then was understood in a
different way than today. Quantity was the criteria. For example, in Santa Cruz
de Tenerife the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Restaurante del Inglés</i>

reached the masses. Young women of good families learned the art of cooking from
their mothers or grandmothers, and they did not disdain the kitchen which, for
better or for worse, was their absolute domain. They learned, experimented and
invented; they would pass on their latest recipes to friends and relatives, and
they frequently kept a record of them in order not to forget them. These
activities, which were a source of amusement for them, have taken on an
importance that they certainly would never have imagined. We must not only thank
them for giving us a view of how people used to eat and live 100 years ago, but
also for something we think about less: they laid the foundation of today's

quality and variety. They would feel proud to know that, in a sense, their work
