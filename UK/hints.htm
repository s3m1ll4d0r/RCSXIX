<p><b><a name="HELPFUL HINTS: BASIC BEEF BROTH">HELPFUL HINTS: BASIC BEEF BROTH</a><br>
<br>
FOR 5 LITRES OF BROTH:<br>
<br>
1 kg of beef shank<br>
1/2 chicken<br>
1 ham bone<br>
2 carrots<br>
2 leeks<br>
1 onion<br>
1 tomato<br>
1 stalk of celery<br>
1 stalk of mint<br>
Clove<br>
Pepper corns<br>
Saffron<br>
Salt<br>
<br>
 Place the chicken, beef and ham bone in a sufficiently large pot with 6 litres of cold water. Add the grated carrots, the whole leeks, the washed tomato (remove the core), the onion with the clove, the peppercorns, the stalks of mint and celery while cooking over the flame. Bring to a boil and simmer for 2 hours (in a pressure cooker, 35 minutes), covered and with the saffron on the lid so that it dries. Taste it to see if it needs salt added (the ham bone already makes it salty). Crush the saffron and dissolve it with a few tablespoons of hot broth before mixing it with the rest. Drain and remove the fat from the broth by straining it through a cloth napkin wetted with cold water. When it is completely cool freeze it.<br>
 The beef and chicken can be used in a variety of recipes (croquettes, cakes, doughnuts etc...).<br>

<a name="HELPFUL HINTS: BASIC FISH STOCK">HELPFUL HINTS: BASIC FISH STOCK</a><br>
<br>
FOR 5 LITRES OF BROTH<br>
<br>
2 kg of fish (or leftovers)<br>
2 carrots<br>
1 onion<br>
1 head of garlic<br>
250 cc of white wine<br>
125 cc of oil<br>
2 laurel leaves<br>
Parsley<br>
Salt<br>
<br>
 Boil all the ingredients together (except the fish) in 6 litres of water. When the onion is well cooked, add the fish and boil for 15 minutes. If you use leftovers, let them cool in the broth. Strain and freeze when it is completely cool.<br>

<a name="HELPFUL HINTS: MAKING PIE CRUST">HELPFUL HINTS: MAKING PIE CRUST</a><br>
<br>
FLAKY CRUST:<br>
<br>
150 g of flour<br>
100 g of butter<br>
2 egg yolks<br>
3 or 4 tablespoons of water<br>
2 teaspoons of sugar<br>
A pinch of salt<br>
<br>
 Sift the flour and mix with the salt and sugar. Put it on the table and make a space in the middle where you place the egg yolks and the butter cut into pieces. Mix the ingredients with the tips of your fingers, adding the amount of water necessary to mix it well and so that it does not stick to your fingers. You should work quickly and not knead it so much that it gets rubbery. In any case, if the dough does get rubbery -be patient- you can fix it easily by leaving it wrapped in a damp cloth for 1 or 2 hours. You can test it to see if it's ready by poking your finger in it: if the mark disappears you should leave it set a while longer. The dough can be kept in the refrigerator for several days in a well sealed container.<br>
 Flatten out the dough with a rolling pin and bake at a high temperature for 10 to 15 minutes. Use it for pies or pastries, etc... If you are going to use a cold filling, bake the crust with a layer of uncooked chick-peas on the bottom so that it keeps it shape and does not rise. Remove the chick-peas when the crust cools. They can be used again in the future.<br>
<br>
CRUST FOR TURNOVERS:<br>
<br>
125 cc of oil<br>
125 cc of white wine<br>
300 g of flour<br>
Salt<br>
<br>
 Combine the oil with the wine and the salt. Add the sifted flour, mixing with a wooden spoon. Make a ball, cover with a damp cloth and let stand in a cool place for at least 20 minutes (it's better to do it the day before). Flatten out the dough with a rolling pin and cut into any shape you wish.<br>
 Use the dough for pies, turnovers, etc...., either for baking or frying. For frying use a good amount of very hot oil.<br>

<a name="HELPFUL HINTS: PUFF PASTRY">HELPFUL HINTS: PUFF PASTRY</a><br>
<br>
250 g of flour<br>
250 g of butter (margarine or lard)<br>
1/2 teaspoon of salt<br>
125 cc of cold water (there will be some left over)<br>
<br>
  Mix the sifted flour with the salt. Gradually add the water, mixing until the dough no longer sticks to your hands. Let stand in a cool place covered with a damp cloth for 15 minutes. The butter or margarine should be cold, but not hard. Spread out the dough in a square shape with your hands on a surface sprinkled with flour. Place the butter in the centre, in a 2 cm- high block and cover it with the edges of the dough, making a kind of package. Flatten out the dough with a rolling pin, beginning in the centre so that the butter gets spread evenly. Make a square with the dough and then begin making the turns in the following manner:<br>
<br>
Turn 1-<br>
 Start with a square sheet of pastry-<br>
 Flatten it out with a rolling pin, more in one direction than  the other, to form a rectangle.-<br>
 Fold the rectangle in three lengthwise ???.-<br>
 Let stand in the refrigerator for 15 minutes.<br>
<br>
Turn 2-<br>
 Turn the dough 90 degrees-<br>
 Spread out the dough again until it takes the form of a rectangle similar to the previous one.-<br>
 Fold the rectangle in three lengthwise ???.-<br>
 Let stand in the refrigerator for 15 minutes.<br>
<br>
Turn 3-<br>
 The same as turn 2.<br>
<br>
 Generally three turns are sufficient but, depending on what the dough is going to be used for, it may be necessary to do more. Puff pastry can be made in advance and frozen, cut in blocks and wrapped in a suitable plastic.<br>
<br>
 This dough is normally used for pies, turnovers, etc... Generally it is baked at a medium temperature for 20 minutes per 1/2 kg of dough. Before baking the dough you can brush on milk or a lightly beaten egg to give it a shine.<br>

<a name="HELPFUL HINTS: FRYING">HELPFUL HINTS: FRYING</a><br>
<br>
 Today, fried dishes have become less popular because of the growing concern for excess calories; but it would be a shame to give up forever the pleasures of a good pastry, a crunchy fish, or breaded meat for fear of getting fat. You don't have to deprive yourself of anything but you don't have to overdo it either. If you use a good olive oil and make sure you drain fried foods well you will avoid taking in too many calories and at the same time control your cholesterol. You only need to follow a few easy suggestions in order for your fried foods to turn out delicious.:<br>
-<br>
 -Use lots of olive oil. You can use the oil several times if you filter it when it's cold and keep it well covered.-<br>
 -Temperature is important. Oil should be very hot but not burn.-<br>
 -To keep oil from spattering when frying fish dry the fish very well first and give it a light coating of flour.-<br>
 -When you take doughnuts or other fried pastries out of the oil you should first let them drain on a rack and then on absorbent paper.-<br>
 -Deep fryers, deep frying pans and cast iron skillets give the best results.-<br>
 -It is always better to do your frying in several small batches, keeping what you have already fried hot while you continue frying the rest.-<br>
- Meat should be salted after frying. Big pieces should be coated with something (breadcrumbs, flour, egg...), with the exception of tender meats which fry very quickly (sirloin, veal...).-<br>
 -If you do not like the taste of olive oil you can give it a milder taste by frying a piece of lemon or orange peel in it, which you remove when the oil cools.-<br>
 -A tablespoon of pork fat in the oil improves any fried dish, as long as it is served very hot.<br>

<a name="HELPFUL HINTS: HERBS">HELPFUL HINTS: HERBS</a><br>
<br>
 Herbs most used in this cookbook:<br>
<br>
LAUREL: Laurus nobilis. Its precise origin, somewhere between southern Europe and Asia Minor, is uncertain. It is a bush that grows to between 2 and 10 metres in height. It has properties as a stimulant and an antiseptic. Its leaves are used fresh, or in dry or powder form.<br>

MINT: Mentha sativa. It is from the east and south of the Spanish mainland. It is a tonic.<br>
<br>
PARSLEY: Petroslinum sativum. It was a sacred plant for the Greeks. It is the most used herb in the whole world. The more decorative chervil or curled variety also exists, but it is less aromatic. It is a diuretic and purifier. It is used in dishes that require a long cooking time because it does not lose its aroma. It goes very well with meats, fish, beans and vegetables.<br>
<br>
OREGANO: Origanon vulgare. It belongs to the Mediterranean region. It has been known since early times for its medicinal properties. It stimulates the nervous system. It is very popular in Italy and used in the most typical dishes. It goes very well with tomato, dressings and marinades.<br>

<br>
CORIANDER: Coriandrum sativum. Although it is used very extensively on the Canary Islands today, we have not been able to find it in any recipes written down from the 19th century, which leads us to believe that it was introduced after that century. Its use at that time was the same as for the rest of Europe: as a seed and in a dry form. The use of fresh coriander is common in India, some parts of Morocco and Central America.<br>
<br>
SAGE: Salvia officinalis. It is from the Mediterranean region. The Greeks believed it had miraculous properties. It is a small bush having gray, velvety leaves, and flowers which grow in clusters.

<br>
 Basically a syrup consists of sugar dissolved in water, which is commonly used in pastry making. It seems rather complicated, but without going into professional details, it may be prepared at home without any problem by following a few basic guidelines. The use of syrup scales or a sugar thermometer is not essential when you become proficient. The amount of water to be added to the sugar is hardly ever mentioned in recipes, for it implies a very personal touch - it depends on the flame, altitude, how fast it boils, etc. - , but we shall offer a suggestion: 250 cc of water per 500 g of sugar. It must dissolve completely before coming to a boil; this is not a problem, although it may take over fifteen minutes. The desired consistency shall depend on how long you let it boil. To check the consistency, remove from the flame, thus avoiding it going past its desired thickness. Going from thinner to thicker densities, the consistencies receive different names:<br>
<br>
1.  SYRUP: a liquid consistency, which is slightly thick a few minutes after coming to a boil.<br>
<br>
2.  THREAD: wet your fingers in cold water, touch the syrup with the tips (there is no problem of getting burned if you do it quickly), join the fingers and separate them. After a slight resistance, a strand will form between the fingers. Depending on the resistance, the consistency shall be a "thin thread" or "thick thread".<br>
<br>
3.  SOFT BALL: pour a teaspoonful of syrup into a glass of cold water, and a little ball which is soft to the touch should form.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
4.  FIRM BALL: the same as number 3, but the consistency should be firmer.<br>
<br>
5.  REFLECTION: when removed from the flame the surface of the syrup should take on a mirror-like appearance. To prevent it from crystallizing - turning into sugar again -  you can add a few drops of lemon juice.<br>
<br>
6.  CARAMEL: the syrup will change color, taking on a honey-like consistency.<br>
<br>
7.  BURNT SUGAR: of a dark colour. Be sure to remove in time, or it will take on a bitter taste.<br>
<br>
 If the syrup described in the last two points is not going to be used at once, let cool to avoid burning, and add hot water little by little while dissolving with a wooden spoon, and place back on the flame; do not let it come to a boil.<br>
 Syrup may be kept in the refrigerator for several days in a sealed container.&nbsp;<br>

<a name="HELPFUL HINTS: SPONGE FINGERS">HELPFUL HINTS: SPONGE FINGERS</a><br>
<br>
 Making sponge fingers yourself is very simple, and it allows you to use only healthy ingredients. Some simple guidelines may arouse the admiration and appreciation of friends and family who, doubtless, will know how to appreciate the advantages of this home-made goody.<br>
-<br>
 Flour must be sifted before mixing with other ingredients.-<br>
Eggs must be very well beaten, either working the yolks and the sugar by hand, and then adding the whites, or, if you have an electric beater, blend all the ingredients together till very frothy.-<br>
Flour should never be beaten, but smoothly mixed with a spatula or wooden spoon.-<br>
It is a good idea to add a little Royal (brand name) baking powder or bicarbonate of soda. No more than 60 g per kilogram of flour, nor less than 30 g.-<br>
Sponge cake must not be baked for less than 15 minutes, nor more than 30, or it would become dry.-<br>
The mold should always be greased with butter or margarine, and sprinkled with flour. This should always be done before you begin preparing the recipe, in order that the dough does not have to wait.-<br>
The oven should also be preheated, so that it reaches the right temperature when the mix is ready.-<br>
If the oven is too hot, the dough will rise at the sides and sink in the center. If not hot enough, the dough will rise in the center and not at the sides.-<br>
Utensils used in baking should be different from those used to prepare salted dishes, for the taste tends to remain, especially on spatulas and wooden spoons.-<br>
The size of the mold should be proportionate to the amount of dough, taking into account that it should not fill the mold more than halfway, or it will rise in the oven.-<br>
If you wish to reduce your cholesterol intake, substitute butter for margarine. The end result will not be affected much.-<br>
To check if the sponge cake is done, insert a long needle through the center to the bottom. It must come out clean and hot to the touch.<br>
<br>

<a name="HELPFUL HINTS: PUDDINGS AND CARAMEL CUSTARDS">HELPFUL HINTS: PUDDINGS 
AND CARAMEL CUSTARDS</a><br>
<br>
 It is possible to turn out excellent desserts without a lot of kitchen work in the kitchen. Also, in the case of puddings, you can use sponge fingers, fruit, bread, etc. that are no longer fit to serve as they are.<br>
- The mold should be previously greased with butter or caramel, depending on the instructions.-<br>
- Caramels and puddings should be double boiled in the oven.-<br>
- The oven must be preheated to the right temperature, and must not be too hot so that the puddings and cakes may cook in the center. -<br>
- Some caramels may be set by double boiling over the flame, as long as the water doesn't boil very briskly.-<br>
- The water in the double boiler must be hot before you place the caramel mold in it.-<br>
- In order for them not to form a crust, they should be covered with a lid or tight-fitting aluminum foil while in the oven.-<br>
- You can tell if they are done if they resist the pressure when you poke your finger, or if a long needle comes out dry.-<br>
- They should be left to cool in the mold and in the water, so that they don't crumble when you remove them.-<br>
 -If the caramel custard or pudding are well set, they can be removed easily. In any case, they should be separated from the sides of the mold with a knife.-<br>
- Puddings which have set after cooling (those with a gelatin base) should be kept in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours. -<br>
- It is better to prepare them the day before and leave them in the mold until they are to be served, with the exception of those which are to be served lukewarm.<br>

<br>
 It is recommendable to have a good kitchen scale, although in many cases its use is not essential if you already know the volume of some common utensils such as glasses or cups and equivalencies of weights and measures.<br>
 Below we give some useful ideas for approximate equivalencies, although we recommend that when making pastries another sweets you weigh the ingredients very carefully, because the success of many desserts depends on achieving proper ratios.<br>
<br>
1 glass (for water):   250 cc<br>
1 coffee cup    250 cc<br>
1 tea cup     100 cc<br>
1 wine glass    150 cc<br>
1 tablespoon     12 cc<br>
1 teaspoon      4 cc<br>
<br>
 These measures are also for solid ingredients. The equivalence in weight of these volumes will depend on the density of the ingredient.<br>
<br>
1 tablespoon<br>
 . of flour     7 g<br>
 . of sugar    12 g<br>
 . of butter    11 g<br>
 . of oil     11 g<br>
 . of honey    18 g<br>
<br>
1 glass or coffee cup<br>
 . of oil    225 g<br>
 . of milk    260 g<br>
 . of wine    250 g<br>
<br>
1 tea cup<br>
 . of oil     90 g<br>
 . of milk    104 g<br>
 . of wine    100 g<br>
<br>
1 litre<br>
 . of oil    900 g<br>
 . of milk      1,040 g<br>

<a name="HELPFUL HINTS: ICE CREAM">HELPFUL HINTS: ICE CREAM</a><br>
<br>
 Today there are some excellent ice creams on the market but we often are not aware of exactly what ingredients are used to make them. The advantages of home-made ice cream are obvious: you can choose the ingredients and avoid using preservatives, artificial coloring, etc...<br>
 In order to make ice cream at home it is not necessary to have a sophisticated ice cream maker (although there are some very good ones). With a normal freezer, a pan and a fork you can prepare any kind of ice cream. In this case, you must take the ice cream out of the freezer every 15 minutes to beat it with a fork in order to break up the ice crystals. In approximately 4 hours you will have perfect ice cream.<br>
 There are many types of ice cream, which we will divide into three basic groups:<br>
- Dairy ice cream. A custard is made with milk and egg yolks, in a ratio of 10 yolks per litre of milk, and 300 g of sugar. If you prefer, you can decrease the number of egg yolks and substitute them for cornstarch (one teaspoon of cornstarch is equivalent to one egg yolk). You can add 25 g of butter per litre of milk.<br>
 The custard should be well chilled before putting it into the freezer.<br>
 Leave a wooden spoon in it to turn it occasionally so that cream does not form while it is freezing.<br>
<br>
- Fruit ice cream. Make a syrup of a thread consistency which you mix with the fruit when it is completely cold. This mixture is made in equal parts. That is, 500 g of sugar and 500 g of fruit puree.<br>
 This type of ice cream should always include a little lemon juice to accentuate the flavor of the fruit. Use the same freezing procedure as the previous one.<br>
<br>
- Creamy ice cream "Gelato". This is the so-called "Italian ice cream". It is very quick to make because there is no cooking involved. For 1/2 l of cream you use 500 g of fruit and 300-500 g of sugar, depending on the sweetness of the fruit you use. If the cream is whipped before adding the ice cream comes out very creamy.<br>
<br>
 By following these suggestions you can make an infinite variety of ice creams, using chocolate, almonds, hazelnuts, canned or fresh fruit, etc...<br>

	The tradition of making preserves used to be to take advantage of the seasonal crops, and to be able to consume them throughout the year. Despite the fact that nowadays we can obtain nearly every kind of fruit all year round, it is better to consume them fresh during their season and to make preserves while they are cheap.<br>
	When making marmalade or jam, it is a good idea to take into account a few basic principles.<br>
-<br>
 Depending on the amount of pectin in the fruit, the jam will curdle with more or less ease. Apples, plums, lemons, quinces and oranges are high in pectin, while grapes, cherries,  melons or peaches have a low pectin content. In some cases it may be desirable to mix several kinds of fruits to obtain the desired consistency.-<br>
 A high concentration of sugar prevents the formation of microorganisms in the preserves. Normally the fruit to sugar ratio is 1 to 1 (i.e. 1 kg of sugar per kilogram of fruit), although this may sometimes vary depending on the sugar contents of the fruit itself.-<br>
 To make jams, you cook the fruit together with the sugar, without adding water, until the desired consistency is obtained. For marmalades you first prepare the syrup, to which you then add the fruit which, if necessary, will have been previously cooked.-<br>
 In order to check whether it is just right, it is not necessary to use a sugar thermometer, although it would be the most precise way of doing so (a temperature of 105°C would indicate the right consistency). Place a little jam on a plate, leave to cool, and pass one of your fingers across the surface while pressing down slightly. If you leave a mark, the consistency is right. With a little experience you will also be able to tell by turning over the spoon you are using to stir and see how thick flakes fall from it.-<br>
 Preserves must be stored in clean, airtight glass jars, which must not be cracked. If the jam has not been left to cool, it is necessary to heat the jar before storing in order to prevent it from cracking.-<br>
 It is preferable to sterilize the jars if the jam is going to be stored for a long time. To do this, once you cover the preserves, roll each jar in a thick cloth to prevent them from clashing, and place them in a large saucepan. Fill with cold water and boil for 30 minutes. Remove when the water has cooled.<br>

<a name="HELPFUL HINTS: JELLIES">HELPFUL HINTS: JELLIES</a><br>
<br>
 There are two types of jellies: sweet and salty. The sweet jellies are basically jelled fruit juices with sugar. The salty jellies are very concentrated beef, fowl or fish broths, precursors of the aspics and gelatins that are used today.<br>
 Although the sweet jellies require more work to make than jams, it is a worthwhile endeavor because of the attractiveness of the final product.-<br>
 When preparing the fruit it is not necessary to peel it or remove the seeds.-<br>
 After cooking the fruit, with little water, you must filter the juice through a cloth, slowly and without stirring.-<br>
 Measure the amount of juice obtained and for every 600 cc add 450 g of sugar.-<br>
 Boil slowly while constantly stirring until it thickens. Its optimum thickness is the same as that of jams.-<br>
 Similar to jams, you must take into account the amount of pectin that each fruit contains.<br>
It is difficult to estimate the amount of jelly that will be obtained from a certain amount of fruit according to its weight because this depends on the species, ripeness, water content, how quickly it is cooked, the amount of water added, etc...<br>
 The salty jellies are made from meat, bones and calf feet, which give it the gelatinous quality. Add vegetables to give the flavor you prefer.-<br>
 You should boil everything together for a long time, in order to get as much flavor as possible from the bones and at the same time reduce the broth.-<br>
 When the broth is done, the fat should be completely removed.-<br>
 Strain through a cloth, and, as with the sweet jellies, do it slowly. If necessary, repeat the procedure several times, until the jelly is completely clear.-<br>
 It can be kept in the refrigerator for several days.-<br>
 For fish jellies, you should add a sheet of gelatin which you can buy in supermarkets; if not it will not set. Another possibility, less recommendable because it alters the taste, is to add calf feet.<br>
